JAiRouter is a Spring Boot-based model service routing and load balancing gateway designed to centrally manage and route various AI model services (such as Chat, Embedding, Rerank, TTS, etc.), supporting multiple load balancing strategies, rate limiting, circuit breaking, health checks, dynamic configuration updates, and more.

[中文介绍](README-ZH.md)

> ⚠️ **LTS Release Notice**: `v2.6.11` is the final Long-Term Support version. No new features will be added to this branch. v3.0 is indefinitely postponed due to limited community demand. The v2.6.x LTS branch will continue to receive security patches, critical bug fixes, and dependency updates for 24 months.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Pull Image

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull sodlinken/jairouter:latest
```

### 2. Generate Secure Keys (Recommended)

**New in v1.8.0**: Key generation tool for automatic generation of secure JWT secrets and admin passwords.

**Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)**

```bash
# Generate JWT secret (Base64 encoded, at least 32 characters)
docker run --rm sodlinken/jairouter:latest java -jar /app/modelrouter.jar --generate-key

# Example output:
# Base64 Encoded (recommended for JWT HS256):
#   cGFzc3dvcmQtdGVzdC1rZXktZm9yLWphb3V0ZXItMjAyNg==
# Key Strength: Very Strong

# Generate random password
docker run --rm sodlinken/jairouter:latest java -jar /app/modelrouter.jar --generate-password

# Example output:
# 16 character password: aB3dEfGhIjKlMnOp
# Password Strength: Strong
```

**Option 2: Using OpenSSL (No jar needed)**

```bash
# Generate JWT secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate random password
openssl rand -base64 24 | tr -dc 'A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&*' | head -c 16
```

### 3. Run Container

**Option 1: Using generated keys (Recommended)**

```bash
# Set environment variables
export JWT_SECRET="cGFzc3dvcmQtdGVzdC1rZXktZm9yLWphb3V0ZXItMjAyNg=="
export INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD="MyStr0ng!Pass#2026"

# Run container
docker run -d \
  --name jairouter \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod \
  -e JWT_SECRET="$JWT_SECRET" \
  -e INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD="$INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD" \
  sodlinken/jairouter:latest
```

**Option 2: Using default password (Development only)**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name jairouter-dev \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev \
  -e JWT_SECRET="your-very-strong-jwt-secret-key-at-least-32-characters-long" \
  -e JAVA_OPTS="-Xms256m -Xmx512m -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n" \
  sodlinken/jairouter:dev
```

### 4. Access Service

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/admin/login
```

![](./docs/capture/login.png)

**Default Login Credentials**:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: The value of `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable set at startup
  - **Development environment default**: `ChangeMeOnFirstStartup123456` (when not set)
  - **Production environment**: Must be set via environment variable, otherwise security warnings will be issued during startup
  - **Recommended**: Generate a strong password using the key generation tool:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm sodlinken/jairouter:latest java -jar /app/modelrouter.jar --generate-password
    ```

After successful login, you can enter the web interface to perform service configuration, management, tracing, and performance analysis operations.
